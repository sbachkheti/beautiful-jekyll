### Who am I?

Hi, I am Samarth (Pronounced some-earth). I was born and brought up in the middle Himalayas. For the past two years, I have been living in the beautiful Scotland. I love running, swimming and biking. After moving to UK, I started cold water swimming. I have cycled across the breadth of Scotland. I have a knack for learning new languages. I am learning French with my lovely friend Nathalie from the surreal French village of Mollans-sur-Oveze in southern France. 
I play [fingerstyle guitar](https://soundcloud.com/samarth-bachkheti) and have been experimenting with the percussive, Celtic and folk Uttarakhandi(India) music for past few months.
