When I am not working, I enjoy running, swimming and biking. After moving to UK in 2018, I have started to enjoy winter swimming/ice swimming in the beautiful Scottish _lochs_. I have expoerimenting with percussive fingerstyle guitar music in Celtic/Gaelic and Indian folk genres. I have penchant for learning new languages. My friend from the beautiful village of Mollans-sur-Oveze helps me to learn French while I help her to learn Hindi. I practice Vipasanna meditation.
